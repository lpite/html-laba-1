                Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve. The
                game is a sequel to
                Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign
                of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and
                defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful
                character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match
                players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in
                player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a
                large structure located within their base.
            </p>
            <p style="width: 100%;">
                Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the
                Ancients, was hired by Valve to design a modernized remake in the Source game engine. It was released
                for Windows, OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013, following a
                Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior. The game is fully free-to-play with no heroes
                or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To maintain it, Valve supports
                the game as a service, selling loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that
                offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs.
                The game was ported to the Source 2 engine in 2015, making it the first game to use it.

                Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional
                leagues and tournaments. Valve organizes the Dota Pro Circuit, which are a series of tournaments that
                award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International, the game's premier
                tournament held annually. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts
                in upwards of US$40 million, making Dota 2 the most lucrative esport. Media coverage of most tournaments
                is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches
                similar to traditional sporting events. In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums,
                broadcasts of them are also streamed over the internet and sometimes simulcast on television, with
                several million in viewership numbers.
